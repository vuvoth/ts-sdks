The Sui Payment Kit SDK is a TypeScript library that provides a simple and secure way to process
blockchain payments on the Sui network. It offers flexible payment processing with built-in
duplicate prevention, configurable payment registries, and comprehensive receipt management.

## Overview

Payment Kit enables developers to integrate secure payment processing into their Sui applications
with minimal setup. The SDK provides two payment models:

- **Registry-based payments**: Persistent payment records with duplicate prevention and configurable
  expiration
- **Ephemeral payments**: Lightweight payment processing without persistent storage

All payments emit a `PaymentReceipt` that can be stored off-chain for verification and
record-keeping.

## Key Features

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Registry-based payments automatically prevent duplicate transactions
- **Flexible Payment Models**: Choose between registry-based or ephemeral payment processing
- **Payment Registries**: Create and manage custom payment registries with configurable policies
- **Receipt Management**: Automatic receipt generation for all payments
- **Multi-coin Support**: Process payments with any Sui coin type
- **Configurable Expiration**: Set custom expiration policies for payment records
- **Fund Management**: Optional registry-managed funds for simplified coin handling

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @mysten/payment-kit @mysten/sui
```

## Quick Start

```ts
import { SuiGrpcClient } from '@mysten/sui/grpc';
import { paymentKit } from '@mysten/payment-kit';

// Create a Sui client with a Payment Kit extension
const client = new SuiGrpcClient({
	network: 'testnet',
	baseUrl: 'https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443',
}).$extend(paymentKit());

// Process a registry-based payment
const tx = client.paymentKit.tx.processRegistryPayment({
	nonce: crypto.randomUUID(),
	coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI',
	amount: 1n * MIST_PER_SUI, // 1 SUI in MIST
	receiver: '0x123...abc',
	sender: '0x456...def',
});

// Sign and execute the transaction
const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
	signer: keypair,
});

// Check transaction status
if (result.$kind === 'FailedTransaction') {
	throw new Error(`Payment failed: ${result.FailedTransaction.status.error?.message}`);
}
```

## Network Support

Payment Kit supports the following Sui networks:

- **Mainnet**: Production environment
- **Testnet**: Testing environment

The SDK automatically configures the correct package and object IDs based on the network specified
in your `SuiGrpcClient` configuration.

## Core Concepts

### Payment Processing

Payment Kit offers two distinct payment processing models to suit different application needs:

1. **Registry-based Payments**: Creates a persistent `PaymentRecord` that prevents duplicate
   payments and provides verifiable proof of payment
2. **Ephemeral Payments**: Processes payments without persistent storage, suitable for scenarios
   where duplicate prevention is handled externally

### Payment Registries

A `PaymentRegistry` manages payment records and configurations. Benefits include:

- Centralized payment tracking
- Configurable expiration policies
- Optional fund management
- Custom naming for easy identification and indexing

### Payment Records

When using registry-based payments, a `PaymentRecord` is created as a Dynamic Field on the registry.
Records are identified by a composite key derived from:

- Payment nonce (unique identifier)
- Payment amount
- Coin type
- Receiver address

### Payment Receipts

Every payment (registry-based or ephemeral) emits a `PaymentReceipt` event containing:

```ts
type PaymentReceipt = {
	paymentType: 'Registry' | 'Ephemeral';
	nonce: string;
	amount: number;
	receiver: string;
	coinType: string;
	timestampMs: number;
};
```
