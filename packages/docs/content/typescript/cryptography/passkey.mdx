title: Passkey
---

Similar to other Keypair classes, the Sui TypeScript SDK provides the `PasskeyKeypair` that handles
communication with the passkey device and signing with it. This SDK defines the address and
signatures according to [SIP-9](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-9.md).

To use, import the `PasskeyKeypair` class from `@mysten/sui/keypairs/passkey`.

```typescript
import {
	BrowserPasskeyProvider,
	BrowserPasswordProviderOptions,
	PasskeyKeypair,
} from '@mysten/sui/keypairs/passkey';
```

## Create a new passkey

To create a new passkey with the passkey device, and initialize a `PasskeyKeypair`, you can use the
`PasskeyProvider` and provide the `rpName`, `rpId` and additional options. Note that
`getPasskeyInstance` call will initialize a new passkey wallet for the origin.

```typescript
const keypair = await PasskeyKeypair.getPasskeyInstance(
	new BrowserPasskeyProvider('Sui Passkey Example', {
		rpName: 'Sui Passkey Example',
		rpId: window.location.hostname,
	} as BrowserPasswordProviderOptions),
);
```

Because a passkey device will only return the public key upon creation, but not upon signing, it is
recommended for the frontend to always cache the `PasskeyKeypair` instance that contains the public
key in the wallet. When a user tries to sign a transaction, it will just call signTransaction on the
same instance and the public key is available when constructing the passkey signature.

It is recommended that the user should only be allowed to create a passkey wallet once per origin.
If the user ended up with multiple passkeys for the same origin, the passkey UI would show a list of
all passkeys of the same origin and the user can choose which one to use. This can be a confusing
experience since they do not remember which passkey is the way that the wallet was created for.

## Recover a passkey

However, if the user is logged out or uses a different browser or device, or the `PasskeyKeypair`
instance is no longer present for any reason, the user should be prompt to recover the public key
(e.g. "Log in to existing passkey wallet") to be able to use the passkey wallet again. If the user
is prompted to create a new key in passkey device, a fresh new wallet with new address will be
created.

One can recover the unique public key with exactly two passkey signatures on two messages. This
means that if the user is asked to sign two messages, the developer can recover an unique public key
and its Sui address.

```typescript
let provider = new BrowserPasskeyProvider('Sui Passkey Example', {
	rpName: 'Sui Passkey Example',
	rpId: window.location.hostname,
} as BrowserPasswordProviderOptions);

const testMessage = new TextEncoder().encode('Hello world!');
const possiblePks = await PasskeyKeypair.signAndRecover(provider, testMessage);

const testMessage2 = new TextEncoder().encode('Hello world 2!');
const possiblePks2 = await PasskeyKeypair.signAndRecover(provider, testMessage2);

const commonPk = findCommonPublicKey(possiblePks, possiblePks2);
const keypair = new PasskeyKeypair(provider, commonPk.toRawBytes());
```

Alternatively, the developer can choose to ask the user to only sign one personal message that
returns two possible public keys. Then the frontend may derive the addresses for both, and check
onchain for the unique address that contains assets. Or the frontend may retrieve additional
signatures from past transaction history for the given address. This may a preferred user experience
since the user is only prompted to sign one message, but the frontend needs to do extra work.

## Usage

The usage for a passkey keypair is the same as any other keypair. You can derive the public key,
derive the address, sign personal messages, sign transactions and verify signatures. See the
[Key pairs](./keypairs.mdx) documentation for more details.

```typescript
const publicKey = keypair.getPublicKey();
const address = publicKey.toSuiAddress();

const message = new TextEncoder().encode('hello world');
const { signature } = await keypair.signPersonalMessage(message);

const txSignature = await passkey.signTransaction(txBytes);
```
