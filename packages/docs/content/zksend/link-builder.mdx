## Limitations

- zkSend only supports Mainnet and Testnet at this time.
- Objects within links must be publicly transferrable.

## Create a link

You can start creating your own zkSend link using the `linkBuilder` method on the zkSend client
extension:

```ts
import { SuiGrpcClient } from '@mysten/sui/grpc';
import { zksend } from '@mysten/zksend';

const client = new SuiGrpcClient({
	network: 'mainnet',
	baseUrl: 'https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443',
}).$extend(zksend());

const link = client.zksend.linkBuilder({
	sender: '0x...',
});
```

#### Adding SUI to the link

You can add SUI to the link by calling `link.addClaimableMist()`. This method takes the following
params:

- **`amount`** (required) - The amount of MIST (the base unit of SUI) to add to the link.

#### Adding non-SUI coins to the link

You can add non-SUI coins to the link by calling `link.addClaimableBalance()`. This method takes the
following params:

- **`coinType`** (required) - The coin type of the coin to add to the link (e.g. `0x2::sui::SUI`).
- **`amount`** (required) - The amount of the coin to add to the link. Represented in the base unit
  of the coin.

The SDK will automatically perform the necessary coin management logic to transfer the defined
amount, such as merging and splitting coin objects.

#### Adding objects to the link

You can add a publicly-transferrable object to the link by calling `link.addClaimableObject()`. This
method takes the following params:

- **`id`** (required) - The ID of the object. This must be owned by the `sender` you configured when
  creating the link.

#### Adding objects created in the same transaction

You can create objects to add to links in the same transaction the link is created in by using
`link.addClaimableObjectRef()`

- **`ref`** (required) - The reference to the object you want to add to the link.
- **`type`** (required) - The move type of the object you are adding

```ts
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();

const link = client.zksend.linkBuilder({
	sender: '0x...',
});

const newObject = tx.moveCall({
	target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::your_module::mint`,
});

link.addClaimableObjectRef({
	ref: newObject,
	type: `${PACKAGE_ID}::your_module::YourType`,
});

// Adds the link creation transactions to the transaction
link.createSendTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
});
```

#### Getting the link URL

At any time, you can get the URL for the link by calling `link.getLink()`.

## Submitting the link transaction

Once you have built your zkSend link, you need to execute a transaction to transfer assets and make
the link claimable.

You can call the `link.createSendTransaction()` method, which returns a `Transaction` object that
you can sign and submit to the blockchain.

```ts
const tx = await link.createSendTransaction();

const { bytes, signature } = tx.sign({ client, signer: keypair });

const result = await client.executeTransactionBlock({
	transactionBlock: bytes,
	signature,
});
```

If you have a keypair you would like to send the transaction with, you can use the `create` method
as shorthand for creating the send transaction, signing it, and submitting it to the blockchain.

```ts
await link.create({
	signer: yourKeypair,
	// Wait until the new link is ready to be indexed so it is claimable
	waitForTransaction: true,
});
```

## Claiming a link

To claim a link via the SDK you can use the `loadLinkFromUrl` method:

```ts
// Load a link instance from a URL
const link = await client.zksend.loadLinkFromUrl('https://zksend.com/claim#$abc...');

// list what claimable assets the link has
const { nfts, balances } = link.assets;

// claim all the assets from the link
await link.claimAssets(addressOfClaimer);
```

## Regenerating links

If you lose a link you've created, you can re-generate the link (this can only done from the address
that originally created the link):

```ts
// url will be the new link url
const { url, transaction } = await link.createRegenerateTransaction(addressOfLinkCreator);

// Execute the transaction to regenerate the link
const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction,
	signer: keypair,
});

// Check transaction status
if (result.$kind === 'FailedTransaction') {
	throw new Error(`Link regeneration failed: ${result.FailedTransaction.status.error?.message}`);
}
```

## Bulk link creation

To create multiple links in a single transaction, you can use `client.zksend.createLinks`:

```ts
const links = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	const link = client.zksend.linkBuilder({
		sender: keypair.toSuiAddress(),
	});

	link.addClaimableMist(100n);
	links.push(link);
}

const urls = links.map((link) => link.getLink());

const tx = await client.zksend.createLinks({
	links,
});

const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
	signer: keypair,
});

// Check transaction status
if (result.$kind === 'FailedTransaction') {
	throw new Error(`Link creation failed: ${result.FailedTransaction.status.error?.message}`);
}
```
