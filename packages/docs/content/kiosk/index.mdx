title: Kiosk SDK
---

Kiosk SDK is a tool to interact with Sui/Mysten Kiosk. You can use it to query kiosk related data,
build transactions to interact, and extend Kiosk to support custom rules.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/kiosk
```

## About

The Kiosk SDK exports a client extension that integrates with Sui clients. Add it to your client
using `$extend(kiosk())` to access kiosk functionality via `client.kiosk`.

> **Note:** The Kiosk SDK requires `SuiJsonRpcClient` or `SuiGraphQLClient`. It does not work with
> `SuiGrpcClient` because it uses event queries that are not available in gRPC.
