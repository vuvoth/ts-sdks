title: useCurrentClient
---

The `useCurrentClient` hook provides access to the blockchain client instance for the current
network.

<Callout type="info">
	By default, this returns a `SuiClient` instance when using the standard setup. However, the dApp
	Kit supports any client that implements the Sui core API, making it flexible for different
	blockchain implementations.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
	All dApp Kit hooks must be used within components that are descendants of
	[DAppKitProvider](../dapp-kit-provider). Using them outside will result in an error.
</Callout>

## Usage

```tsx
import { useCurrentClient } from '@mysten/dapp-kit-react';

export function MyComponent() {
	const client = useCurrentClient();

	const handleQuery = async () => {
		const balance = await client.getBalance({
			owner: '0x...',
		});
		console.log(balance);
	};

	return <button onClick={handleQuery}>Check Balance</button>;
}
```

## Return Value

```tsx
SuiClient;
```
