title: Switch Account
---

The `switchAccount` action changes the currently selected account to a different account from the
connected wallet.

<Callout type="info">
	The "current account" is a dApp Kit concept that tracks which account is active within your
	application. Changing the active account in the dApp does not affect the wallet itself, and
	wallets are not notified when the active account changes.
</Callout>

<Callout>
	Account switching is integrated into the [Connect Button](../web-components/connect-button) Web
	Component. When a wallet is connected with multiple accounts, the button provides an account
	selector.
</Callout>

## Usage

```typescript
import { createDAppKit } from '@mysten/dapp-kit-core';

const dAppKit = createDAppKit({
	/* config */
});

// Switch to a different account
dAppKit.switchAccount({
	account: anotherAccount, // UiWalletAccount from the connected wallet
});
```

## Parameters

- **`account`** - `UiWalletAccount` - The account to switch to. Must be an account that belongs to
  the currently connected wallet.

## Return Value

Returns `void`. The action completes synchronously and updates the connection state immediately.
