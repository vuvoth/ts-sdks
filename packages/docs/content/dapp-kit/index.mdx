The Sui dApp Kit provides tools and components for building decentralized applications on the Sui
network. The SDK consists of two packages that work together:

## Packages

### @mysten/dapp-kit-core

Framework-agnostic core that works with vanilla JS, React, Vue, or any framework:

- Action-based API for direct wallet operations
- Web Components for universal UI elements
- Automatic state management with nanostores
- Smaller bundle size and improved performance

### @mysten/dapp-kit-react

React bindings for the core package:

- React hooks for state and actions
- React component wrappers for Web Components
- Seamless integration with React applications

## Install

Choose the installation method based on your framework:

### For React Applications

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/dapp-kit-react @mysten/sui
```

### Vanilla JavaScript and other frameworks

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/dapp-kit-core @mysten/sui
```

## Getting Started

Check the framework-specific guides:

- [React](/dapp-kit/getting-started/react)
- [Next.js](/dapp-kit/getting-started/next-js)
- [Vue](/dapp-kit/getting-started/vue)

## Legacy Package

### @mysten/dapp-kit (Legacy)

See the [Legacy dApp Kit documentation](/dapp-kit/legacy).

The original React-focused version of the dApp Kit. This package provides:

- React hooks for wallet connection and blockchain queries
- Pre-built UI components with Radix UI
- Integration with TanStack React Query
- Comprehensive wallet state management

<Callout type="warning">
	**Deprecated JSON RPC Only**: This legacy package only works with the deprecated JSON RPC API and
	will not be updated to support gRPC or GraphQL. All new projects should use
	`@mysten/dapp-kit-core` and `@mysten/dapp-kit-react`.
