title: Agent Migration Prompt
---

Copy and paste the following prompt into your AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to
migrate your codebase to v2. If a planning mode is available we recommend starting there first.

```txt
## Sui TypeScript SDK v2 Migration

Migrate this codebase to the latest version of `@mysten/*` packages.

### Step 1: Identify Project Tools

Examine the project to identify:
- Package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun) - check for lock files
- Build tools and scripts in package.json
- Type checking, linting, and test commands

### Step 2: Read the Migration Guide

Fetch and read the full migration guide from:
https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/sui/migrations/v2/llms.txt

This file contains the migration instructions for most affected @mysten package, but please be sure to install the
latest version of all @mysten packages even if they do not have an explicit migration guide

### Step 3: Migrate

Apply the migration patterns from the guide. Do not make changes without first reading the relevant section of the migration guide.

### Step 4: Validate

Run all validation scripts to verify the migration including:

* Type check
* Lint
* Build
* Test

Fix all errors before considering the migration complete.
